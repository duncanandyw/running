Wiring code for an Arduino Uno that generates musical tones and lights in response to sensor-detected impacts.

There is a Fritzing file that shows the simple circuit that goes with the code. A demonstration of how to mount the sensors for the intended purpose (i.e. adding sound to bounce juggling) will likely be added as well. 

Demonstration as a sequencer:
